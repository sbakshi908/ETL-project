2. wikipedia pages for each major tennis tournament were scrubbed and the table with the most recent champs was pulled 

3. api - https://rapidapi.com/sportcontentapi/api/tennis-live-data/endpoints 
Using the Get Matched by date i can call this API and retrieve all the matched on the chosen day

Data Extraction and Transformation: 

The csv was pulled into pandas. Unnecessary coolumns were dropped and renamed as needed. 
the Wikipedia urls were grabbed for each tournament. the HTML was converted into tables. then the correct table - the current champions table, was used and converted into a data frame. An extra column was added to each table that contained the name of that tournament (ex/ US open, French Open, Australian Open, Wimbledon). The last source was an api, I chose the "Get Matches By Date Query" The user enters the date, then using they key and the API query the results will be all the tennis matches with details regarding the court type ,the players, the results etc. This  was converted to JSON formatt, then using a for loop, the tournaments' city, name,surface type, start/end date, player names and IDs were extracted. these were pulled as dictionaries then appended into a list. The list was transformed into a pandas DF. 

Loading:
After all 3 data sources were converted to pandas dataframes, a Mongo connection was extablished. Data base called "ETLdb" was created. For each a respective collection was created - Ranked_players, Match_dates, and Tourn_champs. Then each data base was iterated througn and turned into a dictionary which was inserted in the collection.
